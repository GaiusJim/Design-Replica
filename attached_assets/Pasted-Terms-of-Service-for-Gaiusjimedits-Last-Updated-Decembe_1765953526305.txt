These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the editing services provided by Gaiusjimedits, operated by Gaiusjim (“I,” “me,” or “the Service”). By sending your document(s) to me via email or Dropbox, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to these Terms.
I am an independent academic copyeditor who provides editing support for graduate-level academic documents. I do not write, create, or substantially generate academic content, as this violates academic integrity policies.
2. Services Provided
I offer the following services:
Basic Copyediting
Structural Copyediting
Proofreading + Formatting
These services include corrections to grammar, structure, clarity, coherence, formatting, and academic presentation. They do not include writing, rewriting, generating content, performing research, or contributing to academic work in ways that constitute misconduct.
3. Client Responsibilities
By submitting your document, you agree that:
You have the rights or permission to share the content with me.
The work you submit is your own and does not violate academic integrity standards.
You will provide accurate instructions and deadlines.
You will review the edited document before final submission to your institution.
I reserve the right to decline work that violates academic ethics.
4. File Submission & Delivery Method
Submission of Files
Clients may send documents to me via:
Email
Dropbox
Return of Edited Files
The method for returning edited documents (email, Dropbox, or another mutually agreed method) will be decided between me and the client based on the needs of the project.
5. Revisions
I offer multiple revisions depending on the scope of the work and the agreement made with you at the start of the project. Revision timelines will be discussed and confirmed based on the project size and submission deadlines.
6. Payments
Payment terms are flexible and negotiated individually between me and the client. Payment schedules, deposits (if any), and final fees will be confirmed before editing begins.
Work may begin once a mutual agreement on payment terms is reached.

Your personal data, files, and email are used solely to provide the services you request.

I make no guarantees that edited documents will meet specific academic or publication requirements, although I adhere to professional editing standards.
I am not liable for:
Loss or corruption of files sent through third-party platforms (e.g., Dropbox).
Delays caused by incomplete instructions, late client responses, or technical issues beyond my control.
Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.
Clients are responsible for reviewing the final document before submitting it to any academic institution or publisher.
9. Intellectual Property
You retain ownership of all documents and content you submit. I claim no rights over your work. Edited documents are returned solely for your personal and academic use.
