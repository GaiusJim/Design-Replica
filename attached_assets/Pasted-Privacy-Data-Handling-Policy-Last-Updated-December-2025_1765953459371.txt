Privacy & Data Handling Policy
Last Updated: December 2025

1. Introduction
I am Gaius Jim, an independent academic copyeditor. I respect your privacy and the hard work you put into your research. This policy outlines exactly how I handle your personal information and uploaded documents.
2. Data Collection
I collect your name, email address, and manuscript files solely for the purpose of providing my editing services to you. I do not collect unnecessary personal data, and I do not use cookies for third-party tracking.
3. Confidentiality & Intellectual Property
Your work is 100% your intellectual property. I do not claim any ownership rights over your documents. I strictly adhere to a non-disclosure policy: I never share, sell, publish, or distribute your content to any third parties or public databases.
4. Data Retention Policy
To ensure your long-term privacy, I practice strict data hygiene. All client documents and edited files are permanently deleted from my local and cloud storage 30 days after I deliver the final edit to you.
5. Security Measures
I prioritize the security of your research. Your documents are securely collected and stored using Netlify. I utilize Netlify’s encrypted storage to ensure your files remain private and are accessible only to me.
6. Opt-Out & Third-Party Advertising
I value your control over your data. You have the right to opt out of data collection and targeted advertising at any time.
