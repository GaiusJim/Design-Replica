I edit graduate-level academic documents including theses, dissertations, journal articles, research papers, proposals, and conference manuscripts.

What is the difference between proofreading and structural editing?

Proofreading focuses on grammar, spelling, punctuation, and surface-level corrections. Structural editing addresses clarity, flow, paragraph organization, argument development, and overall coherence.

Do you check references and citations?

Yes. I review citation formatting and consistency according to the required style guide. However, I do not verify the accuracy of source content.

Do you help with formatting (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.)?

Yes. Formatting services are available for every editing service.

Do you rewrite or paraphrase content?

No. I refine clarity and expression but do not rewrite sections to change authorship or intellectual contribution.

Do you provide developmental or content writing support?

I provide structural feedback and clarity improvements, but I do not generate new content or write sections on behalf of clients.

2️⃣ Pricing & Payment
